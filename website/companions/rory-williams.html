					<h1>Rory Williams</h1>
					<h2>Arthur Darvill</h2>
					<p><img src="../images/the-companions/rory-williams.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=""/>Rory Arthur Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.[1] Having been introduced at the start of the 5th series, Rory joins the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5.[2][3][4] As Amy Pond's fianc√©, Rory is initially insecure because he believes Amy secretly loves the Doctor more. </p>
					<p>Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy marry. The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth. In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;, Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend River Song is actually their daughter Melody Pond. The Doctor and River marry in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law. In &quot;The Angels Take Manhattan&quot;, the fifth episode of the seventh series, he and Amy are transported back in time by a Weeping Angel, leading to the couple's departure from the series.</p>
					<p>Rory was a character who was &quot;completely in love&quot; with Amy, but Amy had things to do in life before admitting she loved him too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the &quot;shadow&quot; of Amy's imaginary Doctor.[30] Rory became a nurse because of this.[31] Rory eventually &quot;mans up&quot; and evolves into a &quot;bumbling action hero&quot;.[32][33] Speaking of Rory's characterisation in the first series, actor Darvill felt that he was &quot;on the outside looking into this world he was desperately trying to save Amy from.&quot;[34] Executive producer Steven Moffat had intended to have a married couple on the TARDIS &quot;from the off&quot;.[35] Darvill stated of the couple's marriage that Amy will always &quot;wear the trousers&quot;. However, he felt that Rory's marriage had stopped the character &quot;feeling so unworthy.&quot; In regards to how Rory changed between series five and six, Darvill stated that &quot;his sense of adventure has awoken&quot; and that he is more comfortable with himself.[34]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Williams#cite_note-DarvillPress-34"></a></p>

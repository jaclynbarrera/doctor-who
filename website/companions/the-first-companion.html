					<h1>Rose Tyler</h1>
					<p>Portrayed by Billie Piper</p>
					<p><strong>Rose Tyler</strong> is a fictional character portrayed by Billie Piper in the long-running British Science Fiction television series <em>Doctor Who</em> and was created by series producer Russel T. Davies With the revival of <em>Doctor Who</em> in 2005, Rose was introduced in the eponymous series one premier as a new companion of series protagonist the Doctor in his ninth and tenth incarnations. The companion character, intended to act as an audience surrogate was key in the first series more so than any other to introduce new viewers to <em>Doctor Who</em>, which had not aired regularly since 1989. The series saw Billie Piper receive top billing alongsideChristopher Eccleston and David Tennant both of whom portrayed the Doctor. A regular companion of the Doctor for all of series one and series two, Rose also returned in the programme's fourth series having developed into a harder character.</p>
